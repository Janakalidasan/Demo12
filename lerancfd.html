                   <p class="more">More commonly known as derivatives, CFDs provide exposure to a<br> 
                    market without the trader actually owning the underlying asset.<br>
                    
                    CFDs also allow you to express a view on the future direction of a<br> 
                    market. Effectively you re entering into a contract with us to exchange<br> 
                    the value between the opening price of an instrument, and where you<br> 
                    ultimately chose to close in the future. The distance between your<br> 
                    opening and closing price and your position size will determine the<br> 
                    degree of profit or loss</p>

                    vehicles</h2>
                <p class="more">CFDs offer you the ability to trade global markets whether they re rising<br> 
                    or falling as you can go long or short. Unlike other financial<br> 
                    instruments such as options, there isn t an expiry date on cash-based<br> 
                    CFD trades either.</p>

                <h2 class="what">What is leverage?</h2>
                <p class="more">
                    When trading CFDs, you ll be asked to put down a percentage of the full<br> 
                    market value of the position, known as its exposure. This means you<br>  
                    can achieve a sizeable market exposure with a small initial capital<br>  
                    outlay, known as margin or deposit. It s this idea of leverage, or gearing,<br>  
                    that enables traders the opportunity to trade markets they simply<br>  
                    wouldn t otherwise have been able to.Leverage means a small capital <br> 
                    outlay can go further, but this can also result in increased swings in<br>  
                    profit and loss within your portfolio. As with all financial products, if the<br>  
                    market moves against you, you ll lose money. But because CFDs are<br>  
                    leveraged products, it s possible for you to either gain or lose much<br>  
                    larger amounts compared to your initial capital outlay, and your losses<br>  
                    can exceed your deposits. Therefore, trading CFDs requires closer<br>  
                    attention than unleveraged investments, such as physical shares.</p>

             <h2 class="what">Costs to trade</h2>
             <p class="more">The cost to trade CFDs with us depends on the account type you<br>  
                choose. Find out more about our account types here. The basic cost is<br>  
                what s known as the spread, or the difference between the buy and sell<br>  
                price. There can be additional commission charges to consider too so<br>  
                compare accounts to you find the right account for you depending on<br>  
                your trading needs. There s an interest charge if you hold a position past<br>  
                the rollover point, which takes place a 5pm EST every day and is<br>  
                calculated basis the corresponding swap rate. This can be a<br>  
                consideration for many traders who hold sizeable positions, and they ll<br>  
                often close out before this time. Find out more about <u>swaps, spreads<br>  and commissions here</u><br>

                <p class="more">
                    CFD traders are diverse in their character traits, but our most<br>   
successful clients are ambitious, passionate about financial markets<br>   
and continued learning and have likely had experience trading or<br>   
investing outside of derivatives before taking an interest in CFDs.<br>  

Naturally, our clients have a higher risk tolerance and understand that <br>  
leverage can magnify both profit and loss. A successful trader will have<br>   
a strong consideration and appreciation for managing risk. They like to<br>   
trade methodically, either through automated Expert Advisors (or EAs),<br>   
technical or price action analysis or through more fundamental<br>   
considerations.Due to the high levels of leverage, CFD traders tend to<br>   
hold positions for shorter timeframes, which requires increased<br>   
oversight of positions and the portfolio.</p>
